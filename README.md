# Maze
I developed a fully interactive maze game in the Java console, showcasing algorithmic problem-solving and advanced control flow techniques. The game features multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with progressively complex mazes and unique gameplay elements such as hidden trap doors that teleport the player back to the start. The mazes are represented as 2D arrays, with extended ASCII characters used to visually differentiate walls, open spaces, and the playerâ€™s position, creating a clear and engaging console-based interface without relying on a graphical user interface.

The project incorporates robust user input handling, allowing players to navigate the maze using directional commands while preventing out-of-bounds movement and handling collisions with walls. The game loop dynamically updates the maze state after each move, ensuring smooth and responsive interaction. Additional features, such as level progression and trap detection, required careful planning of control flow and conditional logic to maintain consistent game behavior.

This project demonstrates my ability to translate complex game mechanics into text-based representations, manage state within multi-dimensional arrays, and implement interactive, event-driven logic in a console environment. It highlights my proficiency in Java fundamentals, including arrays, loops, conditionals, and modular code design, as well as my attention to detail in creating a challenging yet fair user experience.
